# Step 6: Remove firms with missing HSA/HRA contribution information

# Step 7: Remove firms with missing policy information
# e6, f6, and d6 contain policy information for the non-HDHP plan slots
# g6 contains the corresponding HDHP policy information 
# so we remove a firm when 
# all of d6, e6, and f6 are missing OR g6 is missing (so we need policy info for both the non HDHP and the HDHP)

# which variable is checked depends on the firm's plan combination 
# pty = 5 -> use d9 / d9bx

# a firm in this sample should have info for 1 non HDHP plan and one HDHP plan
# d6, e6, and f6 are the possible slots for the non HDHP plan
# so we remove firms where MORE THAN ONE of those non HDHP slots is filled in

#### SECTION 2: Restructure the data from wide to long ######


# Up to this point, each row represents one firm
# but each firm can have information for several plan types in different columns
# so we use reshape long so that each row represents one firm-plan instead of one firm

# Step 13: Create variables used in the reshape 
# the original Stata code creates g2 and g4 as empty variables before renaming plan-specific variables

# Convert rename commands into a data frame

# d1   -> fr11
# e1   -> fr12
# f1   -> fr13
# g1   -> fr14
# The last digit tells us which plan type the variable belongs t

# g40 -> cs404

# Step 15: Replace the numeric plan suffix with a readable plan name
# The authors use numbers at the end of their variable names:
# 1 = HMO
# 2 = PPO
# 3 = POS
# 4 = HDHP
# For our  dataset, we are going to replace those numbers with readable plan names instead
# Example:
# prmsa1 -> prmsa_hmo
# prmsa2 -> prmsa_ppo
# prmsa3 -> prmsa_pos
# prmsa4 -> prmsa_hdp

# We turn these into labeled categories so the dataset is easier to interpret.

# Step 19: Remove plan rows that were not offered
# The reshape creates four possible rows for every firm: HMO, PPO, POS, and HDP.
# But each firm in our sample only offers two of these so the rows corresponding to plans the firm does not offerhave missing values for cs6.
# The original Stata code says: drop if cs6=
